README for python-fitz
======================

python-fitz is a set of python bindings for `MuPDF <http://www.mupdf.com>`_ rendering library. Most of the work is done by `SWIG <http://www.swig.org>`_ with ``-builtin`` option on.

Dependencies
------------

This module depends on MuPDF(version=1.1). 

By default, fitz is compiled as a static lib. If that's the case, you need to recompile MuPDF with ``-fPIC`` option.

Install
-------
Extract the tarball and run

	python setup.py install

Run

	python setup.py --help

for more information about installation.
