The different format handlers (pdf, xps etc) interpret pages to a device. These devices can then process the stream of calls they recieve in various ways:

* The bbox device calculates the bounding box for the page.
* The draw device will render them.
* The list device stores them in a list to play back later.
* The text device performs text extraction and searching.

Device can be created by :

* :func:`new_bbox_device`
* :func:`new_draw_device`
* :func:`new_draw_device_with_bbox`
* :func:`new_list_device`
* :func:`new_text_device`
