.. _Cookie:

===========
**Cookie**
===========

Provide two-way communication between application and library. Intended for multi-threaded applications where one thread is rendering pages and another thread wants read progress feedback or abort a job that takes a long time to finish. The communication is unsynchronized without locking.

.. warning::
   
   Multithread is not implemented yet, so just use ``None`` where it is needed as a parameter.
